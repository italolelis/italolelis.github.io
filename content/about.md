I'm a brazilian living in Berlin, Germany. Currently working as Engineering Manager [@N26](https://twitter.com/n26).
In the past I worked at [HelloFresh](https://twitter.com/hellofresh) mostly doing things in [go](https://golang.org/).

Please, checkout my open source contributions on [github](https://github.com/italolelis).

Do you have a great idea that you'd like my help on? Wanna leave some feedback? Please, feel free to reach me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/italolelis)

Thank you!
