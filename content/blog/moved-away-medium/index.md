Recently, I moved away from posting new things on Medium. Medium started as a great platform for independent bloggers publishing their amazing work to the world. I have a few reasons why I moved away and they are quite simple:

## 1. Experience
Medium has a simple yet powerful reading experience... or better, it had. In the very good old ays of medium it was a plesure to read through a lot of articles over the platform. Relevant recommendations were given all the time and you could easily go from one good article to another. Things have changed and now all I see is paid articles, terrible recommendations and a bad UX experience.
I like to have control on how readers will find my articles, read through them and even the kind of great fonts like [Montserrat](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat), wich are pleasant to read, they will look at.

## 2. No tracking, no ads, no paywall
Recently, Medium introduced a monetizing model called paywall. This essentially enables a content writer to say if they want their articles to be monetized. The problem is that Medium only allows you to read 3 paid articles per month. A lot of writers are creating content thinking that they will earn quite some money if they enter the paywall. Unfortunately, this kind of aggressive monetizing strategy generates [tons of complaints](https://mobile.twitter.com/search?q=paywall%20medium&src=typed_query&f=live).

To mention an example, many of my recommendations are now paid:

Another example is the painful web mobile experience, full of pop ups:

## 3. Open source
My blog is open source. I'm a huge open source fan boy, I think OS is how you can build and learn great things together. I wanted the same experience for my content. I can now version my articles, open up to anyone to collaborate in any topic they want and it's perfect for other people to help me translate my articles into any language. I know I don't have a big viewer base, but it's something I'm trying to build by having my own blog. It's a long road but that's part of the journey.

## 4. Hugo
Static site generator is not something new but [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) really level up the game. Hugo is a great static blogging platform that is highly customizable, easy to learn and fun to use.
With hugo I can easily change any theme, fonts, comment platform, tracking, anything. Continuous deployment of my changes are done via [netlify](https://www.netlify.com) and for free.

Medium was a great platform for me in the early days and helped me publish a few interesting articles. I'm am very grateful to [medium](https://twitter.com/Medium) for allowing this to exist for a while. Now a new journey is about to start

See you in the next article :wave:
